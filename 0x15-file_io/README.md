This is my readme for this project, crazy input and output project called file handling. I really wanna know C but it has been really hard so i guess i would just get through shell and face python. The pressure and stuff is crazy. Whoever reads this, just know i was deep in pain because i haven't been able to understand c although i thought i did. Hopefully, though, i hope i come back to this and say i conquered c later on. With hope, from Mayowa, November 2023.
